This is an example test used to show the minimal configuration
of the AutoCMS testing system.
<br /><br />
The test runs a mockup of a scientific application called 
'frobnicate.sh' which writes some random information to standard output,
runs for a variable amount of time, and sometimes fails or pretends 
to segmentation fault. 
<br /><br />
To use AutoCMS with your own application with minimal scripting, simply
replace the 'frobnicate.sh' command in 'bare_test.slurm' with the setup 
and execution of your own application.
