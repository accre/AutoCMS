This is an example test used to show the features of the AutoCMS testing system.

This test counts the number of processes running on a worker node, then simulates 
rolling two dice by generating random numbers between 1 and 6. It reports 
the sum and makes a histogram of the results over the last day. It also sleeps 
for a random interval between 0 and 600 seconds.
